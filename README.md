Completed sixth form in Singapore after having lived in Tokyo before continuing my studies in Computer Science at the University of Bath for which I achieved a Bachelor Of Science award with First-class honours. 

My repositories contain some of the work completed as part of my undergraduate degree, in addition to personal projects I have undertaken to expand my frame of knowledge and experiment with different technologies.
